The object (turret) is split into 3 parts to make it more easy to print.

The small holes on the base are used for passing M2.5 screws.

The smaller holes on the top part are used for passing components leads (such as LED's and detectors).

The square hole on the top part is used for exposing the Raspberry Pi Camera that goes inside this part.

The two cannons are used for 5mm LEDs.
